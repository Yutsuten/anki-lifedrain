# Life Drain [![CodeFactor](https://www.codefactor.io/repository/github/yutsuten/anki-lifedrain/badge)](https://www.codefactor.io/repository/github/yutsuten/anki-lifedrain)

An [Anki](https://apps.ankiweb.net/) add-on that adds a life bar to your reviews.

Your life reduces within time, and you must answer the questions in order to recover it.

## Objective

The objective is to give a visual feedback of how fast the questions are being answered.
If the life is low, it means that you are distracted or taking too much time to answer.
